<!-- All the capabilities of the LEDs on this device, stored as a bit field.
         This integer should equal the sum of the corresponding value for each
         of the following capabilities present:

         LIGHTS_RGB_NOTIFICATION_LED = 1

         // Device has a color adjustable battery light.

         // The notification light has adjustable pulsing capability.
         LIGHTS_PULSATING_LED = 8

         // Device has a multi-segment battery light that is able to
         // use the light brightness value to determine how many
         // segments to show (in order to represent battery level).
         LIGHTS_SEGMENTED_BATTERY_LED = 16

         // The notification light supports HAL adjustable brightness
         // via the alpha channel.
         // Note: if a device notification light supports LIGHTS_RGB_NOTIFICATION_LED
         // then HAL support is not necessary for brightness control.  In this case,
         // brightness support will be provided by lineage-sdk through the scaling of
         // RGB color values.
         LIGHTS_ADJUSTABLE_NOTIFICATION_LED_BRIGHTNESS = 32

         // Device has a battery light.
         LIGHTS_BATTERY_LED = 64

         // The battery light supports HAL adjustable brightness via
         // the alpha channel.
         // Note: if a device battery light supports LIGHTS_RGB_BATTERY_LED then HAL
         // support is not necessary for brightness control.  In this case,

         For example, a device with notification and battery lights that supports
         pulsating and RGB control would set this config to 75. -->
